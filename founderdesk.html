						Dear Patrons, Friends and Donors,
						It is my pleasure and delight to be able to express through this medium my profound gratitude, that of the members of the board of trustees, the little children, and the missionaries, to you all for your consistent support. The vision has been proven and tested. It is established in the hearts of all who know us that it is a vision from God, therefore it will not fail because God has raised you, our patrons and donors, as co- laborers with us. We are builders and restorers of lives.

							Dear Patrons, Friends and Donors
						</h3>
						<p align="justify" style="color: green">
							It is my pleasure and delight to be able to express through this medium my profound gratitude, that of the members of the board of trustees, the little children, and the missionaries, to you all for your consistent support. The vision has been proven and tested. It is established in the hearts of all who know us that it is a vision from God, therefore it will not fail because God has raised you, our patrons and donors, as co- laborers with us. We are builders and restorers of lives.
						</p>
						<p align="justify" style="color: green">
							The past few years have been full of challenges, but glory to God we have surmounted everyone of them. We have come out stronger, more passionate and more determined to finish the race that God has set before us. We can never fail because God cannot fail. Our help comes from God. His GRACE is continually being multiplied and his mercies renewed in our lives. The Glory of the latter shall be greater than that of the former.
						</p>
						<p align="justify" style="color: green">
							Patrons, please do not be weary of giving to the Eromosele Orphanage Home. Your giving redounds to the glory of God. The excellence of the vision, the well being of all the little children and the ever increasing prosperity in your lives is evidence that you are giving to a great and divine cause. Keep it up!
						</p>
						<p align="justify" style="color: green">
							It is a delight to me and I believe it pleases God to see our young Nigerians coming to volunteer their time at the orphanage. Every year, Loyola Jesuit College, Abuja and St Francis Catholic Secondary School Idimu Lagos, send their students to render one month of voluntary service annually.
						</p>
						<p align="justify" style="color: green">
							Children from nursery, primary and secondary schools in Lagos come regularly to visit the little saints and the Youth Corpers are not left out. It's a pleasant sight to behold, and we rejoice because this was one of the prayer points at the onset of the vision. That our young should be touched with the feelings of their less privileged peers, so that they can grow up to be unselfish and generous. To see this come to pass strengthens our faith in God and our Little Saints' Day slogan ' Catch the Spirit of Love, Spread the feeling' is working.
						</p>
						<p align="justify" style="color: green">
							We continue to pray that generations after ours will be more compassionate than we have been. They will not allow or tolerate the oppression and negligence of the needy that is prevalent in our society today. There is hope! I assure you things will only get better as long as all those in humanitarian services do not give up.
						</p>
						<p align="justify" style="color: green">
							In 2008, I initiated the formation of the Association of Orphanages and Homes Operators in Nigeria (ASOHON). This was a move towards unity and cooperation to enhance the welfare of all vulnerable children in orphanages. To unite, to protect and promote their rights. We have a strong board of trustees of founders and many states are keying into the vision of ASOHON, you can visit our website: www.asohon.org.ng
						</p>
						<p align="justify" style="color: green">
							In May 2015 , ASOHON received a coveted and enviable AWARD OF RECOGNITION from the Lagos State Ministry of Youth and Social Development. It was their own way of appreciating the efforts of orphanage founders and operators . We are very zealous to work harder. We are excited!
						</p>
						<p align="justify" style="color: green">
							The Board of Trustees of Little Saints Orphanage is deeply grateful to God for the addition of Ibadan home to the orphanage. Operations have started and we thank God for all the children that will be rehabilitated and reformed in that home. They will all receive the same love and care we have given to all the little saints that makes them outsatnding!
						</p>
						<p align="justify" style="color: green">
							As a human being I sometimes feel I can't do anymore or go further, but then God says to me, 'Its not over until I say so!' my response is " Your will is my command". Everyone of us in this vineyard have to rely on the grace of God to take us beyond our limitations. His Grace is sufficient for us. We thank all our education Sponsors, all our magnanimous donors and friends, you are equipping the Little Saints for a bright and glorious future. God will faithfully multiply your sources of wealth, give you long life, peace and joy to enjoy the fruits of your works.
						</p>
						<p align="justify" style="color: green">
							We are reaching out for help to organizations and everyone who want to see a change on our streets especially as there are plans to transform Lagos into a Mega City. The time to take our children off the streets is now, if George Muller did it in 18th century England, why can't we do it in Nigeria? All things are possible with God.
							From Lagos, this fire of love for needy children is spreading across the nation and beyond. Watch and see what the Lord will do!
						</p>
						<p align="justify" style="color: green">
							The question is, are you willing to be a part of making history for the needy children of Nigeria? Then join our team and let's build a SAFE HAVEN FOR CHILDREN. This is our ultimate project for the evacuation of street children for reformation and reintegration.
							Thank you for reading this, we look forward to seeing you face to face.
							Grace and Peace to you and your wonderful families. We anticipate your visits with joy and thanksgiving to GOD. WE APPRECIATE YOU!!!
						</p>

							With a grateful heart,
