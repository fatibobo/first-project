						Dear Patrons, Friends and Donors,
						It is my pleasure and delight to be able to express through this medium my profound gratitude, that of the members of the board of trustees, the little children, and the missionaries, to you all for your consistent support. The vision has been proven and tested. It is established in the hearts of all who know us that it is a vision from God, therefore it will not fail because God has raised you, our patrons and donors, as co- laborers with us. We are builders and restorers of lives.

							<h3 style="color: red">Adoption / fostering Procedures</h3>
							<p align="justify" style="color: green">To adopt / foster a baby or a young child from the Eromosele Orphanage Home is not impossible.
							It is not without labour!
							It takes nine months for a woman to bring a baby into the world. So adopters should be ready to go through the necessary procedures or fulfill the necessary conditions to adopt a baby.
							The first thing we look for in our adopters is love. Compassion must be visible.
							Adoption is an act of love. It must come from a desire to love a child. It must be motivated by our love for God. It must be because we want to raise a child for God as a demonstration of our love for God. Every child is a gift from God. Every child is an object of our love for God and for humanity. So if you want to adopt a child from the Eromosele Orphanage Home then be ready to love the child for the rest of your days. Be ready to be accountable for the success of that child. Be ready to be a good steward of the gift. Every child is a gift to humanity and if nourished properly will enhance the human race.
							<h3>FIRST STEP</h3>
							<p align="justify" style="color: green">
